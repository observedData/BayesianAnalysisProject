# BayesianAnalysisProject
In this project, we used self-reported survey data from selected states to examine the association between prenatal depression and postpartum persistent opioid use. Because opioid use and depression are often stigmatized, study participants may not feel comfortable answering those sensitive questions. As a result, there is missing information in our dataset which makes it not representable to the study population. Using a Bayesian approach, we can handle missingness in our dataset by doing posterior draws of both covariate and outcome variables. Through imputation, we can make posterior inferences of the association between prenatal depression and postpartum persistent opioid use. 

In this repository, you can find the code that I used to generate the result.
